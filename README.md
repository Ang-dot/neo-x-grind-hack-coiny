## 𝐏𝐫𝐨𝐛𝐥𝐞𝐦 𝐒𝐭𝐚𝐭𝐞𝐦𝐞𝐧𝐭
Managing multisig wallets and staying secure in the Web 3 space can be complex and overwhelming, especially for new users. Traditional multisig setups are often tedious, notifications lack immediacy, and fraud prevention mechanisms lack transparency and adaptability. Our goal is to lower entry barriers, improve security, and enhance user experience through AI and decentralized technologies.

## 𝐅𝐞𝐚𝐭𝐮𝐫𝐞𝐬

### 🔍 On-Chain Fraud Behavior Detection Powered by Explainable AI and Cartesi
Our AI-driven fraud detection system uses **LIME (Local Interpretable Model-agnostic Explanations)** to analyze transactions in real time. This gives users clear, actionable insights into why a transaction might be flagged, enabling smarter decision-making. **Cartesi Rollups** handle complex computations off-chain for scalable, transparent fraud detection while settling critical data on-chain.

### 🤖 AI Agent-Powered Wallet Creation
With a single prompt, users can set up a multisig wallet without the usual repetitive steps. This feature leverages Google Gemini AI agents to streamline the setup process, making it accessible even for those with no technical experience. 

### 🔔 Seamless 2FA Authentication 
Integrated **Two-Factor Authentication (2FA)** powered by **WorldID** adds an extra layer of security with privacy-preserving, zero-knowledge proofs.

### 🎮 Bonus: The Thai Challenge: A New Take on Rock, Paper, Scissors
Adding a unique twist, Ka-Ching features a blockchain-powered game inspired by Thai street life—Tuk-Tuk, Traffic Jam, and Food Cart—where users can settle the age-old question of "Who’s covering the gas fee?" 

| **Element**   | **Defeats**    | **Reason**                                                    |
|---------------|----------------|----------------------------------------------------------------|
| Tuk-Tuk       | Traffic Jam    | Tuk-Tuk zips through the traffic.                              |
| Traffic Jam   | Food Cart      | Traffic Jam blocks the Food Cart.                              |
| Food Cart     | Tuk-Tuk        | The Food Cart feeds the hungry driver (because who can resist Thai street food?) |
